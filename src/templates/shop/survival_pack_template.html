<h3>Why It Works: The Cognitive Science Behind FirePhrase</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lexical Sentence Mining:</strong> Learn words in context, not in isolation, making use of the innate ability of the brain to internalise language. For example, "I have made a decision", rather than "to make" and "decision" word and grammar tables</li>
<li><strong>Dual-Coding:</strong> Pair phrases with specific images to create mental 'hooks' that improve recall by up to 75%.</li>
<li><strong>Phonetic Decoding:</strong> Practice with normal and slow-speed audio to master pronunciation and natural rhythm.</li>
<li><strong>Active Recall:</strong> Use fill-in-the-blank cards to strengthen memory retrieval for real-time conversations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
<p>Spend 20-30 minutes per day to make steady progress. Each pack progresses in this order:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Listening Cards:</strong> Start by hearing the phrases to train your ear for natural rhythm and pronunciation.</li>
<li><strong>Reading Cards:</strong> Reinforce your understanding by seeing the phrases in written form.</li>
<li><strong>Speaking Cards:</strong> To build confidence and fluency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explore and enjoy the language with AI-powered learning insights and links to online dictionaries for deeper understanding.</p>

<p><em>Note: Anki is completely separate from our store but is the platform our flashcards use. It's the gold standard for spaced repetition learning.</em></p>
<p>AI Insights work by copying a customised prompt for each card to your clipboard, that you can paste into an AI chatbot of your choice (such as Gemini or Claude). We are a subscription-free product and therefore do not offer this as a paid feature.</p>
