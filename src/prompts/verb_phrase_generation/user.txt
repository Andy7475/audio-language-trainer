Generate phrases for the verb: "$verb"

Task:
1. Generate 3 base phrases using different tenses and contexts:
   - One showing PRESENT tense usage
   - One showing PAST tense usage
   - One showing FUTURE tense usage
   Mix different pronouns and sentence types (question, imperative, statement), focussing on combinations that are common for the verb.

2. If the verb has multiple distinct meanings in English, generate 1-3 additional phrases (one per meaning), using the most useful tense for each meaning:
   - Example: "break" could mean "physically separate" OR "interrupt" - generate one phrase for each
   - Example: "run" could mean "move quickly" OR "operate/manage" - generate one phrase for each

3. For each phrase, identify any additional words you generated beyond the verb itself:
   - These are auxiliary words that would help exhaust a vocabulary list
   - Example: If you generated "I want an apple", record "apple" as an additional word
   - Record these words so they can be struck off the vocabulary list

Guidelines:
- Each phrase should be 3-5 words (aim for this, but ensure each utterance makes grammatical sense)
- Be specific but also vary between concrete and generic examples
- No idioms or colloquial expressions
- phrasal verbs are OK and count as 1 word (e.g. I'm going to swim in the sea, {I'm going to} swim in the sea = 5 'words')
- Ensure every phrase is something a learner would realistically say or hear

Use the generate_verb_phrases tool to return your response with the structured phrase data.
