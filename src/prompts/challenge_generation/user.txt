Analyze the following story and create 5 practical roleplay scenarios for $target_language_name learners.

Story Context (English):
$story_context

Create 5 scenarios that:
1. Relate to themes and vocabulary from the story
2. Each has a main challenge to complete (e.g., "Order a coffee")
3. Each requires discovering specific information (e.g., "What is the price?")
4. Each includes 3 realistic complications that:
   - Explain why the original request can't be fulfilled
   - Suggest or hint at alternatives
   - Don't prevent discovering the required information

Requirements:
- Make scenarios feel like real-world situations
- Keep challenges achievable for learners
- Ensure complications offer a path forward
- Success means both completing the challenge AND discovering the information
- Use vocabulary similar to the story where possible

Use the generate_challenges tool to return your response with the structured scenario data.
