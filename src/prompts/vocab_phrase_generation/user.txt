Generate phrases for the following vocabulary words:
$target_words

Additional context - nearby vocabulary words you may use to create interesting combinations:
$context_words

Task:
1. For each target word in the list, create exactly ONE phrase
2. Each phrase must be GRAMMATICALLY COMPLETE and NATURAL:
   - Be 3-5 words long (can extend slightly if needed for proper grammar)
   - MUST include proper articles (a, an, the) where grammatically required
   - MUST have complete prepositions (e.g., "on the table" NOT "on table")
   - MUST sound natural when spoken aloud by a language learner
   - Contain NO verbs (no actions, just descriptions, states, or positions)
   - Feature the target word as a primary element

3. Grammar checklist for every phrase - MUST satisfy all:
   ✓ Has proper articles (a/an/the) for all nouns
   ✓ All prepositions are complete with articles (on the, in the, by the, with the)
   ✓ Word order is natural and idiomatic English
   ✓ Sounds like a natural noun phrase a learner would hear or say
   ✓ No fragments or incomplete structures

4. Use context and creativity:
   - Use adjectives, nouns, prepositions to create visual or conceptual combinations
   - You may optionally use words from the context list to create interesting combinations
   - Create memorable, visualizable scenarios
   - Create variety across phrases - don't repeat similar patterns
   - Examples of GOOD phrases: "a red apple on the table", "the old wooden door", "the blue window curtains"
   - Examples of AVOID: "red apple" (missing article), "on table" (incomplete preposition), "big house" (too generic)

5. For each phrase, identify any additional words you generated (beyond the target word):
   - Example: If you create "a white mug on a shelf", record "white", "mug", "shelf" as additional words
   - These will be struck off the vocabulary list
