Generate phrases for the following vocabulary words:

Additional context - nearby vocabulary words you may use to create interesting combinations:
$context_words
Task:

For each target word in the list, create exactly ONE phrase
Each phrase must be GRAMMATICALLY COMPLETE and NATURAL:

Be 2-5 words long (can extend slightly if needed for proper grammar)
MUST include proper determiners where grammatically required
Determiners include: articles (a, an, the), possessives (his, her, my, our, their), quantifiers (two, three, some, many, few), demonstratives (this, that, these, those)
MUST have complete prepositions with determiners (e.g., "on the table" NOT "on table")
MUST sound natural when spoken aloud by a language learner
Contain NO finite verbs or verb phrases (no actions like "is running", "will eat", "has taken")
Participial adjectives are fine (e.g., "broken window", "painted fence", "sleeping cat")
Feature the target word as a primary element


VARIETY REQUIREMENT - This is critical:

Distribute determiners naturally across ALL phrases
Avoid defaulting to "a" or "the" for most phrases
Include possessives: "his ham sandwich", "my coffee cup", "their old house"
Include quantifiers: "two perfect circles", "some bread and butter", "three red apples"
Include demonstratives: "these old books", "that blue door"
Aim for diverse patterns - not all phrases should follow the same structure


Grammar checklist for every phrase - MUST satisfy all:
✓ Has proper determiners for all nouns
✓ All prepositions are complete with determiners (on the, in the, by the, with the)
✓ Word order is natural and idiomatic English
✓ Sounds like a natural noun phrase a learner would hear or say
✓ No fragments or incomplete structures
✓ No finite verbs (but participial adjectives like "broken" or "sleeping" are acceptable)
Use context and creativity:

Use adjectives, nouns, prepositions to create visual or conceptual combinations
You may optionally use words from the context list to create interesting combinations
Create memorable, visualizable scenarios
Maximize variety in phrase patterns and structures
Examples of GOOD phrases: "a red apple on the table", "the old wooden door", "some blue curtains", "his warm jacket", "two small plates"
Examples to AVOID: "red apple" (missing determiner), "on table" (incomplete preposition)


For each phrase, identify any additional words you generated (beyond the target word):

Example: If you create "a white mug on a shelf", record "white", "mug", "shelf" as additional words
These will be struck off the vocabulary list
