Analyze this dialogue from a story scene and create a first-person perspective image prompt to visualize the location and atmosphere:

$dialogue

Create a detailed prompt for generating an image that captures the location, setting, and atmosphere of this scene.

Your prompt should:
1. Use first-person perspective as if the viewer is participating in the scene
2. Focus on the environment, setting, and background elements
3. Do NOT include the main characters (Alex, Sam, or similar named characters) in the description
4. Include background people for atmosphere, but keep them generic and unnamed
5. Include time of day, weather, and atmospheric details if mentioned or implied
6. Capture the emotional tone of the conversation in the environment
7. Limit output to 1-2 sentences focused on visual elements only
8. Do NOT add image style details - those will be added separately
9. Do NOT include any written text, words, or letters in the image - it should be purely visual and pictorial
10. Provide ONLY the image generation prompt, without any explanations

Example dialogue: "Alex: It's such a beautiful day! Sam: I know, let's have coffee on the terrace and watch the sunset."
Example output: "View of a bustling city square from a cafe terrace, morning light streaming through trees, people walking past market stalls"
