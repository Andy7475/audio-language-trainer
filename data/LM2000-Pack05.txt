Flowers attract bees naturally.
The museum attracted many visitors.
Will this attract customers?
She attracts attention everywhere.
The boss grants permission.
The judge granted bail.
Will you grant access?
I am calculating the total
She calculated the cost
Will you calculate it?
Winter is approaching fast
She approached the building
Will you approach him?
This soup tastes good
I tasted the sauce
Will you taste it?
Taste this before serving
I can taste salt
Don't waste your time
I wasted the money
It will waste water
This illness wastes muscles
She lifts heavy weights
He lifted the box
Can you lift this?
This lifts my spirits
What do you recommend?
She recommended the restaurant
Will you recommend something?
This affects everyone here
The news affected him
Will it affect you?
She affected a smile
I handle customer complaints
She handled it well
You can easily handle this
Handle the box carefully
That wooden post by the grey fence
The medical lesson was helpful
My trousers are in the cupboard upstairs
The heavy pack is a worry
Look at the full extent of the increase
A formal arrangement is needed
It's an important aspect of the vote
A cheque and a cheese pie on the table
The cold wind never stopped.
The band with guitars had a big fight
We have an alternative tool in the pack
There is a rough edge on this cupboard
There are two aircraft near the target
They ate a messy salad
A bold political claim
We made progress on an alternative goal
Those people are kind
A row of red bikes
The owner is worried
Take the first step
She was very attractive
Would you like some milk?
They were unusual circumstances
