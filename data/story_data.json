    "dialogue_generation_prompt": "Create a brief dialogue for language learners using the following guidelines:\n    1. This is for language practice. Only use words from the lists provided below.\n    2. Pick from about 3 of these verbs:\n    meet, stand, fall, go, speak, eat, play, hope, like, study\n    You can use other verbs if required to make the tenses work (e.g., auxiliary verbs).\n    3. Use at least 10 words from this vocabulary list:\n    child, telephone, sorry, why, cinema, during, outside, tense, thanks, on, next, is, bicycle, am, Sweden, always, by, politics, I'm, theatre, person, no, well, lot, brilliant, football, how, in, him, by, was, often, mother, probably, politics, three, I, because, until, while, crown, present, yesterday, student, meeting, tonight, clever, problem, yourselves, cup, kettle, wife, angry, better, evening, not, telephone, radio, then, year, trip, today, different, dinner, when, sick, policeman, or, on, hard, month, back, long, day, his, time, person, wine, tea, are, easy, him, what, this, warm, during, lift, funny, tea, myself, important, she, yesterday, am, time, dining, money, from, question, door\n    4. Focus on these grammatical concepts (use each at least once, but no more than twice):\n    Future Perfect Continuous, Present Perfect, Frequency\n    5. Create a conversation with 6-8 lines of dialogue total (about 20-30 seconds when spoken).\n    6. The characters are Alex and Sam. Maintain their personalities and relationship from previous dialogues.\n    7. Recap from last episode: Sam has been taking a French course and is feeling mentally exhausted. Alex suggests having coffee, and they decide to grab breakfast at the university coffee shop before their next meeting, as Sam is hungry and it's too early for dinner.. You can (if necessary) reuse vocab words from the recap to maintain continuity, but prioritise the vocab list provided.\n    8. Output the dialogue in JSON format with speakers clearly labeled. For example:\n    {\n        \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Alex\", \"text\": \"Hello! How are you today?\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sam\", \"text\": \"I'm doing well, thanks for asking.\"}\n        ]\n    }\n    8. Current story phase and plan: resolution: They participate in the competition, growing closer as friends and more confident in their language skills.\n    9. Create dialogue for the current story plan.\n    Remember:\n    - Only use words from the provided lists.\n    - Balance practicing the specified concepts and vocabulary (about 60%) with advancing the storyline (about 40%).\n    - Keep the language simple and appropriate for intermediate language learners.\n    ",
