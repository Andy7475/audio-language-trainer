Maintain their personalities and relationship from previous dialogues.\n    7. Recap from last episode: Alex informs Sam about a newly announced language competition involving twelve intensive French lessons over the next month. Despite initial apprehension about the workload, both students recognize the potential benefits, including improved language skills and accent recognition. They decide to start preparing for the competition, beginning with a cup of coffee.. You can (if necessary) reuse vocab words from the recap to maintain continuity, but prioritise the vocab list provided.\n    8. Output the dialogue in JSON format with speakers clearly labeled. For example:\n    {\n        \"dialogue\": [\n        {\"speaker\": \"Alex\", \"text\": \"Hello! How are you today?\"},\n        {\"speaker\": \"Sam\", \"text\": \"I'm doing well, thanks for asking.\"}\n        ]\n    }\n    8. Current story phase and plan: falling_action: They prepare for the competition, supporting each other through difficulties.\n    9. Create dialogue for the current story plan.\n    Remember:\n    - Only use words from the provided lists.\n    - Balance practicing the specified concepts and vocabulary (about 60%) with advancing the storyline (about 40%).\n    - Keep the language simple and appropriate for intermediate language learners.\n    ",
