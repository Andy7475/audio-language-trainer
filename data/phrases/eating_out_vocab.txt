a crisp white tablecloth
the elegant crystal wine glasses
a steaming bowl of tomato soup
the aromatic freshly-baked bread
some chipped china plates
the polished silver cutlery
a romantic candlelit atmosphere
the busy outdoor terrace seating
a dirty menu with greasy fingerprints
the cold tangy lemon sorbet
a hearty beef pie with gravy
the creamy chocolate mousse dessert
some wobbly wooden bar stools
some fresh strawberry ice-cream
another clean napkin, please
the fragrant herb-crusted salmon fillet
a chilled bottle of sparkling water
the sizzling garlic prawns starter
a noisy open-plan kitchen
smoked cheese with fresh trout
the tender slow-cooked lamb shank
roasted vegetables in a spicy sauce
some colourful vintage crockery
the refreshing gin and tonic aperitif
a cramped corner table for two
the rich red wine reduction sauce
some crusty sourdough bread slices
the zesty citrus salad dressing
a generous portion of chunky chips
the smooth, hot pumpkin soup
the crispy golden-brown onion rings
