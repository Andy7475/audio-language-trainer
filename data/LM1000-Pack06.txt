I miss my family
Did you miss the bus?
She will miss the meeting
He missed the target
Don't miss this opportunity
Plants grow in sunlight
She grew tomatoes yesterday
Will they grow taller?
The company is growing
I grew tired quickly
Shut the door please
She shut the window
I'll shut it later
The shop shuts early
He suffers from allergies
She suffered a loss
They will suffer consequences
I suffered an injury
What happens next?
It happened yesterday.
It will happen soon.
Don't drop the glass
She dropped her phone
I'll drop you home
Can you drop me off?
The temperature dropped suddenly
I start work early
When did you start?
We'll start the meeting
Start the car now
I get up early
She got the book
Will you get milk?
I'm getting tired now
Get away from the edge!
They got home late
She draws every day
I drew a picture
Will you draw it?
Draw the curtains please
They drew the wrong conclusion
I prepare breakfast daily
She prepared the report
Will you prepare dinner?
Prepare for your exam
That was an excellent class
Write your message on the board
A bottle under the bench
A football on the check-in desk
My savings earn interest
They played fairly 
Someone strong from the North
The start of the weekend
A wrong opinion about most things
My brother has a fair share
No one is poor
A good example
It's my parents' anniversary
Nearly perfect timing
It's just for this afternoon
Not until my birthday party
Presumably your normal routine?
My work was a success
My leg hurts
Memories from the past
Is there fresh fruit available?
A clean working environment
A special occasion, perhaps?
A community with slightly different views
This road is under construction
A quarter of the cake
The minister is in town
This is the proper approach
