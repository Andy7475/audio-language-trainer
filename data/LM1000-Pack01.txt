I open the door
She opened the window
Will you open it?
The store opens tomorrow
Open your book please
She explains the concept
I explained my decision
Can you explain this?
Please explain your reasoning
I run every morning
She ran yesterday
Will you run tomorrow?
He runs a business
The water is running
She wears blue jeans
I wore a hat
Will you wear this?
I follow the rules
She followed the instructions
Will you follow me?
Please follow the path
I follow that channel
The lecture follows dinner
She figured it out
It figures prominently
Ask a question
She asked for help
Will you ask him?
May I ask something?
I ask for directions
It moves slowly
We will move soon
Please move over
They moved to Paris
I realise my mistake
She realised the truth
When will they realise?
She wins every time
We won the game
Will they win tomorrow?
The day before yesterday
Definitely the right information
A fact about the world
Around an ordinary office
A difficult job
It was a large order
An officer at the college
My lovely husband
Outside in the water
Half of the time
It's about his trust issues
There are people behind the office
Apparently she's single
A little too straight
Certainly the right point
We have no trust
A difficult word
Our budget is $1000
Shall we open it
On the open water
A pretty blue flower
Is there anybody in the room?
For a little while
The human body
Quite a beautiful sunset
Two equal parts
All of them together
You and your friend
The cold winter weather
A serious medical condition
My father's old watch
Less sugar in my coffee
