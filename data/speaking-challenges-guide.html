    <h1>Interactive Speaking Challenges Guide</h1>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Speaking challenges</strong> are interactive roleplay scenarios designed to help you practice real-world conversations. Each challenge involves completing a task while gathering specific information, with potential complications that might arise - just like in real life! You'll interact with an AI language assistant who responds naturally and provides helpful feedback.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How the Challenges Work</h2>
    <div class="key-features">
        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Task-Based Learning</h3>
            <p>Each scenario has a main task to complete (like ordering coffee) and specific information you need to discover (like finding out the price).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>ðŸ”„ Natural Dialogue</h3>
            <p>The AI assistant stays in character and responds naturally, allowing you to practice real conversation flow and timing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
            <h3>âš¡ Real-World Complications</h3>
            <p>Some scenarios include unexpected situations you'll need to handle - just like in real life!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="how-it-works">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Choose a Scenario:</strong> Each scenario shows what role you'll be talking to (like a shop assistant) and what you need to achieve.</li>
            <li><strong>Start the Challenge:</strong> Click 'Start Challenge' to begin the conversation. The AI will greet you in character, but you might need to say an initial 'hello' in your target language to begin.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete Your Tasks:</strong> Try to complete both the main task and gather the required information.</li>
            <li><strong>Handle Complications:</strong> Some versions of each scenario include unexpected situations you'll need to work around.</li>
            <li><strong>End the Session:</strong> The conversation will continue until you say 'END SESSION' or successfully complete your tasks. The AI isn't great at ending the session by itself, so I find it's best to say 'END SESSION' when you think you are done.</li>
            <li><strong>Tips and Tricks:</strong> It works best if you let the AI finish the sentence, then you reply. Lots of interruptions sometimes cause it go out-of-sync a bit.<br>You might need to prompt it to tell you the answer to the thing you were trying to find out</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>Special Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pause Roleplay:</strong> Say "PAUSE ROLEPLAY" at any time to:
            <ul>
                <li>Get help with phrases or vocabulary in English</li>
                <li>Understand what you should do next</li>
                <li>The roleplay will resume when you're ready</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Natural Extension:</strong> Feel free to expand the conversation beyond the basic task - the AI will stay in character!</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> After completing the challenge, you'll receive feedback on:
            <ul>
                <li>What you did well</li>
                <li>Areas for improvement</li>
                <li>Alternative phrases you could have used</li>
                <li>Ask it for the answer to your task (e.g. what the price of coffee was)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h3>Things to Note</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>OpenAI uses the same model for all languages</li>
            <li>It works well on common languages like Italian, French etc</li>
            <li>I can't vouch for how accurate or competent it is, especially on lower resource languages.</li>
            <li>Try not to interrupt to prevent weird latency issues</li>
            <li>Feel free to copy and/or edit the prompt to use in a different website or modify the challenge</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Costs</h2>
    <p>The Realtime API is comparatively expensive compared to other services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Budget for about 20p per conversation (a couple of minutes)</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on your OpenAI billing page for more info</li>
    </ul>
