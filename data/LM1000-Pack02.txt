I'm using this computer
She used my pen
Will you use it?
They use too much water
Use this hammer
I want some water
Did you want this?
They will want help
I expect good results
Did you expect that?
Expect a surprise
They will expect us tomorrow
She's expecting a baby
Leaves fall in autumn
She fell on the ice
Will it fall down?
Prices are falling fast
I'm washing my clothes
She washed the dishes
Will you wash the car?
Wash your hands
They allow pets here.
She allowed me in.
Will you allow it?
Press the button firmly
She pressed the doorbell
Press the flowers flat
I put it here earlier
She put the book down
Where will you put it?
Put on your shoes
I put him first
He's standing near the door
She stood by the door
Will you stand over there?
I can't stand it
Stand still!
The building still stands
Does it matter to you?
It mattered a lot.
Nothing will matter then.
What's the matter with him?
One huge tree
Which glass ring?
He is afraid of the fire
A bit tired obviously
A conversation with mum
Anyone from the church
A cheap phone line
He is a member of ours
Possibly during the evening
A full drink indeed
the front month record
the real suggestion
Such a lovely evening
Such trouble for daddy
a set against the wall
few options though
trouble with myself usually
Nobody is near to the fire
Clearly in the front
a tree during play
a sense of ought to
the effect on society
After the low period
Why our society works
a low table
We try to understand
