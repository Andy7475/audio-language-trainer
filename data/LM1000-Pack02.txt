I'm using this computer
She used my pen
Will you use it?
They use too much water
Use this hammer
I want some water
Did you want this?
They will want help
I expect good results
Did you expect that?
Expect a surprise
They will expect us tomorrow
She's expecting a baby
Leaves fall in autumn
She fell on the ice
Will it fall down?
Prices are falling this month
I'm washing my clothes
She washed the dishes
Will you wash the car?
Wash your hands
They allow pets here.
She allowed me in.
Will you allow it?
Press the button firmly
She pressed the doorbell
Press the flowers flat
I put it here earlier
She put the book down
Where will you put it?
Put on your shoes
I put him first
He's standing near the door
She stood by the door
Will you stand over there?
I can't stand it
Stand still!
The building still stands
Does it matter to you?
It mattered a lot.
Nothing will matter then.
What's the matter with him?
One huge tree
A cheap glass ring
He is afraid of the fire
I'm a bit tired, obviously
A conversation with Mum
Anyone from the church?
Washing on the line
A member of the club
Possibly, during the show
A full drink indeed!
Such a clear evening
We are in such trouble
A set of golf clubs
It's a new record
The brick wall is real
There are a few options
A bike in a low gear
Nobody is in trouble
I can see clearly
We ought to recycle glass
It has an effect on society
