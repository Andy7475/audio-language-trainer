BASED ON THE ÅRE MURDERS:
HIDDEN IN SHADOWS

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,960
BY VIVECA STEN

2
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,000
Mom!

00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,640
THE ÅRE MURDERS

4
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,440
HIDDEN IN SHADOWS
PART 1

5
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,560
Good morning, sunshine.

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,920
I would've driven all the way,
but some idiot's blocking the way.

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,640
Here you go.

8
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,640
Coffee…

9
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,880
Cool, or…

10
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,960
Okay.

11
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,280
What's up?

12
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,920
Just that a body shows up
the day before you go on parental leave.

13
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,920
Do you know
what Bruce Lee's favorite drink was?

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,880
No.

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,520
Watah!

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,920
-Go!
-Okay.

17
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,840
POLICE LINE - DO NOT CROSS

18
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,120
When's Ylva coming?

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,520
In two or three hours.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
We've found

21
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,200
a left leg over there

22
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,680
and a right hand, I think,
over by the bridge.

23
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,520
It's called the suicide bridge.

24
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
Hi, this is Johan.
I can't take your call right--

25
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,360
We still haven't found
the left forearm or the right leg.

26
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,640
It's a male, that much we can establish,

27
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,240
but we haven't been able
to establish his identity.

28
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,959
Someone mentioned suicide, but…

29
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,079
If the person was alive

30
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,200
when the body was torn apart
and the head landed in the snow,

31
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,720
there should be,

32
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,040
well, livor mortis on his right cheek,
from resting against the ground.

33
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,840
However, livor mortis
is present on the neck,

34
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,840
which may suggest
that the person was already dead

35
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,480
when the body was torn apart
in the train collision.

36
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,720
There's a blunt impact injury to the head
I'd like to take a look at…

37
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,040
Sorry, I'll just…

38
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,280
Impact, like from a blow?

39
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,400
I don't know.

40
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,440
To establish that,

41
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,600
I need to examine the remains
back at the lab.

42
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
Look.

43
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,760
The clothes and the body
are covered in these.

44
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,800
Red cotton fibers.

45
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Here.

46
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,880
Thank you.

47
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm heading home.

48
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,080
Yeah, I'll stay. I need a few minutes.

49
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,000
I understand.

50
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,960
You're not going to Bygget?

51
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,480
No, I don't think so.

52
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,520
-See you.
-See you tomorrow.

53
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,400
Fucking pig!

54
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,440
-Hi.
-Hi.

55
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,120
Hi!

56
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,920
It's so nice to see you! Join us inside!

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
-It's so crowded.
-Yeah, but it'll be so fun!

58
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
-I'm really not up for it.
-Join us.

59
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm going home.

60
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,440
Okay, I get it.

61
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
-What?
-You want to dance, so let's dance.

62
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,920
-No, I'm heading out.
-Out?

63
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
-Yes.
-For a smoke?

64
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,280
-What?
-I'm going to smoke. Come.

65
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,080
Come on.

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,720
You want to swing by?

67
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,800
-Let me just…
-No, it's the last one.

68
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,800
No, sorry.

69
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,520
This is the police. How may I help?

70
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,320
Hi. It's probably nothing…

71
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,880
I just…

72
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,920
My husband hasn't been home all day, and…

73
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,520
And I can't reach him on his phone.

74
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,200
You wake up happy.

75
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,080
Let's say goodbye to Mommy.

76
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
Good morning, Mommy.

77
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,320
-Oh my! Hi!
-I'm awake.

78
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,280
There.

79
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,760
Hello, sweetie!

80
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,320
-God, I'm going to miss her.
-She won't even know you've been away.

81
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,240
-No.
-Okay, go.

82
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,040
-You're messing up our routine.
-Which is?

83
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,960
The morning news, black coffee,
dinner ideas from Steffo…

84
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,000
Then I'm going to eat these thighs…

85
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,320
-Can you take her?
-I don't have time.

86
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,840
-I don't have time.
-Real quick.

87
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,159
Do you want to come to Mommy?
Then Mommy's leaving.

88
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
Should I take you in my bag?

89
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,040
-Hi.
-The remains belong to Johan Andersson.

90
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,080
Former ski star and partner of J&L Event.

91
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,160
-Resident of Duved.
-Oh.

92
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,920
-Is it him? I saw him win World Cup races.
-Yeah, his…

93
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,200
His wife reported him missing last night.

94
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,640
Has she been informed?

95
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,800
I want you and Hanna to take it.

96
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,040
And Daniel, the cause of death

97
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,760
was a heavy blow to the head

98
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,600
with a blunt or flat object.

99
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,000
He can't have fallen on the track?

100
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
It's unlikely.

101
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,320
The injury is too high up.

102
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,760
So it's murder.

103
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,320
So it would seem.

104
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,360
I'm sorry, but we need you.

105
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,640
Can you postpone your parental leave?

106
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,200
I don't think Hanna
should do this on her own right now.

107
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,240
No, of course not.

108
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,640
-Thank you, Daniel. See you later.
-Okay.

109
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,920
Johan?

110
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,200
God… We worked together at Ski Hill.

111
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
Damn, that's sad.

112
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
-Who the hell would want to murder him?
-Grip wants me to lead the investigation.

113
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,400
Well, that's not possible.

114
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,120
-You're on parental leave this week.
-I know that.

115
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,120
No.

116
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,280
What can I do?

117
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,400
Ida, Grip needs me.

118
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Listen, this training is really important
for my career.

119
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,720
I know,
but you can take the course next year.

120
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,480
So I'm supposed to unpack my bag
and stay home with Alice?

121
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,320
What can I do? You can't put
a murder investigation on hold.

122
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,320
No, but you can put my life on hold.

123
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,320
I barely saw you
during the last murder investigation.

124
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,680
I stayed home with Alice who had colic,
so I think it's your turn.

125
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,400
-I know. I'm sorry.
-Just figure it out.

126
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,600
Hi, sweetie.

127
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,960
Hi!

128
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,080
Kisses.

129
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,840
I love you.

130
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
Bye.

131
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,640
-Okay. Bye, honey.
-Bye.

132
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,600
She's pooped, so change her.

133
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,240
-Do it right away.
-Yeah.

134
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,360
Bye.

135
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,880
-Hey.
-Hey.

136
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,440
Ida's out of town, but…

137
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,600
-It'll be fine.
-I can take Anton instead.

138
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,400
-No, it's fine.
-It's not a problem.

139
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,840
-I'll go by the book--
-It's fine.

140
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,240
Or I can take Anton,
and you can grab a coffee.

141
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,840
Okay. Did someone wake up
on the wrong side of the bed?

142
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,640
Wake up? I haven't even slept.

143
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Okay.

144
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,800
Sure.

145
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,960
Sorry.

146
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,920
No worries.

147
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,280
Hanna Ahlander, Åre PD.

148
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,280
This is my colleague, Daniel Lindskog.

149
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,240
-Hi.
-Hi.

150
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,160
Have you found him?

151
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,920
Yes.

152
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,600
Okay… What happened?

153
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,840
Maybe we should go inside.

154
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,320
He's dead.

155
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,440
Our condolences.

157
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,360
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

158
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,400
We're not skiing off-piste
with Johan Andersson?

159
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,640
I don't know where the hell he is,
but it's been a nice day.

160
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,680
-You can't do this at home.
-No, but…

161
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,640
Excuse me.

162
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
J&L Event, Linus Sundin.

163
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,840
-Rafael Herrera, Åre PD.
-We expect a full refund!

164
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,040
I'm out with clients. What is it?

165
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
-It's about your colleague.
-What?

166
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,280
Your colleague, Johan Andersson,
has been found dead.

167
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,960
When can we talk to you?

168
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,840
-Hi.
-Hi.

169
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,840
-Are you Leo's dad?
-He's Leo's biological dad.

170
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,320
-Jens.
-Daniel.

171
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,200
Leo.

172
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,440
Do you remember the last time
you saw Johan?

173
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,840
-I told you that…
-We had breakfast together.

174
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,560
Okay.

175
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,680
Then you went to a concert in…

176
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,080
in Östersund?

177
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
You and your mom?

178
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,520
Do you remember what time?

179
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,920
The concert started

180
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,120
at 7:00

181
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,120
with an opening act.

182
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,800
Okay.

183
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,360
And what did you do after?

184
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,440
We slept at the hotel.

185
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,400
Then we left early,

186
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,040
the day after.

187
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,680
Johan wasn't at home when we got back.

188
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,280
But sometimes he sleeps at his office.

189
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,480
He had a…

190
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,080
a dinner that night,
with a childhood friend.

191
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,360
Carl Willner.

192
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,960
How long ago was it
that you separated from Marion?

193
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,760
Well, 12 or 13 years ago.

194
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,560
How was your relationship with Johan?

195
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,240
I mean, he's been really good for Leo,
so I'm very grateful for that.

196
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,040
Leo.

197
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
Will you catch whoever did it?

198
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,480
We will.

199
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
We'll do our best.

200
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,480
Let's go home.

201
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
Listen.

202
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,000
-Call us anytime.
-Okay. Thank you.

203
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,320
Johan was having dinner
with a childhood friend the night he died.

204
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,680
Carl Willner.

205
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,720
Yeah.

206
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,640
I have to stop by Ida's mom's.

207
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,680
She went for a walk with Alice
and locked herself out.

208
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,480
I'll just take Anton.

209
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,000
Tips are pouring in.

210
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,920
-Really?
-Yes.

211
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
"Last night,
I heard loud noises from underground."

212
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,200
"I saw the murderer in my dreams."

213
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,400
-You're cheery today.
-Some people…

214
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,880
Here's a dog owner

215
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,880
who saw a dark van with a broken taillight

216
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,280
on the dirt road
between the train station and the bridge.

217
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,520
That could be something.

218
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,440
Yeah.

219
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,680
Hi. Carl Willner?

220
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,080
Yeah, he's over there.

221
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,280
We just need a minute.

222
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,400
-Hi.
-Hi.

223
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
Hanna Ahlander, Åre PD.

224
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,360
-Carl. Hi.
-My colleague, Anton Lundgren.

225
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,480
-Hi.
-Hi.

226
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,400
Oh, do you know each other?

227
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,360
-Well…
-No.

228
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,640
No, we've never met.

229
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,560
Right.

230
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,240
Well, you've heard what happened to Johan.

231
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,440
Yes.

232
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,480
Marion said that…

233
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,080
Are you sure that…

234
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
It can't have been an accident?

235
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,120
No, we're treating it as a crime.

236
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Damn.

237
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,880
Johan was here. He…

238
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,880
It was strange, actually.
He showed up with a bloody nose.

239
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,280
He stopped the bleeding with a shirt, but…

240
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,440
He seemed very stressed
and left almost immediately.

241
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,000
-And the shirt? What did he do with it?
-He threw it in the dumpster out back.

242
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
He said he'd fallen.

243
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,760
Why did he come here?

244
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,640
We were supposed to have dinner. He…

245
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
Well, we do it every week.

246
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,320
But he just stopped by to cancel.

247
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,080
Fuck.

248
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,480
You said he stopped by.
Where was he going?

249
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,640
He said he was going out of town.

250
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,560
Where to?

251
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
I don't know.

252
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I assumed it was work-related,

253
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,520
but now it sounds strange.

254
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,840
-When was he leaving?
-Later that night.

255
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,200
-Is this the shirt?
-Yes, exactly.

256
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,440
Let's book it.

257
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,240
Okay.

258
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,560
The deceased has been identified
as downhill skier Johan Andersson.

259
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,000
Next of kin have been notified,
and the police is invest--

260
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,280
Hello?

261
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,480
We've had a board meeting
and decided not to renew the lease.

262
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,360
What the hell? We had a deal.

263
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,600
The board have made its decision.

264
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,760
Are you kidding me?

265
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,680
Cunt!

266
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
You fucking Jesus freaks.

267
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,200
You're going to regret this.

268
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,640
The same day as my partner…

269
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,640
Linus, it's our land.
The congregation has every right to…

270
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,080
-But you promised to renew the lease.
-Things have changed.

271
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,840
-Johan's dead.
-Hey, you fucking cunt!

272
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,720
STAFF CARE
HAVE A NICE WEEKEND

273
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,880
I'm coming, honey!

274
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,560
-Hello?
-It's an emergency.

275
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,240
Hi.

276
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,040
Thank you. Come in.

277
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,600
I'm coming.

278
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,440
She's finally asleep. Sit down.

279
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,160
-Do you want a drink?
-No, thank you.

280
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,440
No, okay. Hey, sorry for the mess.

281
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,360
-I haven't had time to clean.
-Don't worry.

282
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,640
I'll just tidy up a bit.

283
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,800
I was thinking about…

284
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,000
I saw that this event agency had…

285
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,000
I looked at their Insta
and saw they had posted a picture.

286
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,160
The guy next to Johan has a shirt
just like the bloody one Anton found.

287
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,720
That's Johan's partner, Linus Sundin.
We're interviewing him tomorrow.

288
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Well done, Hanna.

289
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,360
I'm glad you're here in Åre.

290
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,920
Raffe went through J&L Event's books.
Apparently, they've applied for a loan.

291
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,360
We don't know
if Johan or Linus made the application.

292
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,960
Both had signatory authority.
But what I wanted to show you…

293
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Hold on.

294
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,400
My head's been killing me.
I haven't been able to sleep.

295
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,680
I thought it was a tumor,
but Ida made me go to the optician.

296
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,680
It turns out I need glasses.

297
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,880
But I haven't received them yet.

298
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,240
How much money are we talking about?

299
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,640
Half a million.

300
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,400
I wonder if the company, or one of them,
had financial problems, but…

301
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah.

302
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,800
Should we…

303
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,520
continue tomorrow?

304
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,480
-Yes.
-Now that Alice is asleep, I should also…

305
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,920
Yeah, of course. Yes.

306
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,600
Thank you for the formula.

307
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,200
-You saved me.
-No worries.

308
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,040
-Hi.
-Hi.

309
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,240
I take it you've heard.

310
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,880
Well, how's Leo coping?

311
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,280
I can't believe it.

312
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
Do the police know
what could have happened?

313
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,440
I don't know.

314
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,360
Nothing?

315
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,240
Hey, you need to clean out the garage.

316
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,160
You can't keep your liquor there.
The police will snoop everywhere.

317
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,960
Everything has to be gone by tomorrow.

318
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,360
-Okay?
-Okay.

319
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,360
Our thoughts today
are with Johan Andersson and his family.

320
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,680
Some of us knew him personally.

321
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,400
He was well-known and appreciated
in our village.

322
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,160
Such a reminder of our mortality
can give rise to fear.

323
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,800
But it can also pave the way for

324
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,680
forgiveness and reconciliation.

325
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,520
MISSED CALL

326
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,120
CARL
CAN WE MEET?

327
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,240
-Hi.
-Hey.

328
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,680
I just wanted to come here

329
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,320
to tell you in person that I'm…

330
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,360
Well, I'm a cop.

331
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,840
Well, I guess you noticed that, but…

332
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,480
Since you're a witness
in a murder investigation,

333
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,440
you and I can't…

334
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,720
We can't see each other anymore.

335
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,720
You haven't come out yet, huh?

336
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,720
Well, it's a bit complicated.

337
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,640
Hey… Man, sorry if I…

338
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,840
I get it.

339
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,560
It sucks, but I get it.

340
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,920
So I'm just going to cancel your booking.

341
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,960
You'll get the booking fee back as well.

342
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,720
Thank you. Bye.

343
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,120
-Hi.
-Hi. Hanna Ahlander, Åre PD.

344
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,520
I heard you have questions.

345
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,880
Yes, exactly.

346
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
But I'd like to take a look
at Johan's office first.

347
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,000
Yeah, should we…

348
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,600
TUESDAY 20TH
PILGRIMSFJÄLL

349
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,440
TUESDAY 27TH
PILGRIMSFJÄLL

350
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,080
What's Pilgrimsfjäll?

351
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,360
Pilgrimsfjäll?

352
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,320
I don't know.

353
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,760
I don't know what it is, but…

354
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,480
-Do you know what might have happened?
-We don't know.

355
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,400
Do you recognize this?

356
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,880
Johan used it to stop a bleeding.

357
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,200
He must have borrowed it.
It's been here in the office.

358
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,880
What happened to your lip?

359
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,040
Sorry, can we do this over the phone?

360
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,560
-I…
-We're almost done.

361
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,400
-I have pick up my son.
-It'll be quick. We're almost done.

362
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,960
The lip?

363
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,840
We were going to make an investment,

364
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,080
build a high ropes course, and…

365
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,680
The same day it happened,

366
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,280
I had discovered that Johan
hadn't signed on for the loan, so…

367
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,080
We were at the office.
I confronted him about it.

368
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,880
He had suddenly changed his mind.

369
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,000
And we started arguing.

370
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,840
Who threw the first punch?

371
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,680
He did.

372
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,880
I just defended myself.

373
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,400
MOTHER-IN-LAW

374
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,760
Where were you later? In the evening?

375
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,280
I watched my son's hockey practice.
Then I went home and…

376
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,080
Jens and I…

377
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,560
-We sat and…
-Jens Wernolf?

378
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,120
-Leo's dad?
-Yes, exactly.

379
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,280
He's renting my guest cabin
until he finds his own place.

380
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,800
We watched soccer until half past eleven.
Then I went to bed.

381
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,600
I have to take this.

382
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,480
What made Johan change his mind?

383
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,520
I have no idea.

384
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,320
You don't know?

385
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,680
No.

386
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,480
-But you knew him well?
-Yes, but he refused to tell me why.

387
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,880
It's got to do
with the congregation we're leasing from.

388
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,880
Their pastor, Ole Nordhammar…

389
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,480
Johan didn't like him. I don't know why.

390
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,400
Okay.

391
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,320
Listen.

392
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,120
I've known Johan all my life.

393
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,680
He was like a brother to me.

394
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,960
I loved him.

395
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,120
I would never…

396
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,800
Okay.

397
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,760
Don't leave town
until we've verified your alibi.

398
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,720
Sure.

399
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,440
-Didn't you get my text?
-No.

400
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,720
-Well, I don't want any more.
-What?

401
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,160
The police were here.
They could come back anytime.

402
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,680
Absolutely not.
I placed an order for two months.

403
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,840
All right,
then I'll have to cut your throat

404
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
and kill you.

405
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm only joking.

406
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,560
-Well, this is the last one.
-Sure.

407
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,360
-Has she been good?
-Yes, like an angel.

408
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,200
-But she might be hungry.
-Okay, thank you.

409
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
Bye.

410
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,720
…Raffe

411
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,440
Cumpleaños feliz

412
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,720
What do you wish for?

413
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,840
A raise.

414
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,600
Congratulations.

415
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,600
-Congrats.
-Wow.

416
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,880
-Finally 60.
-Thank you.

417
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,800
Thank you, Anton.

418
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,800
But… PiscoLogía!

419
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,960
Wow, thanks so much. From?

420
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,800
-From all of us.
-From all of you. Thanks so much.

421
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,160
We understand English.

422
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,240
I promised the boys to go night skiing.

423
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,880
Go sit down.

424
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,360
Give me ten minutes.

425
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,320
He used to wear a wedding ring.

426
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,640
Where is it?

427
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,560
It was found like that,
with a glove on, without a ring.

428
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,920
-It was found like that.
-Why take off your wedding ring?

429
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,680
Well, if you're fighting,
seeing someone else, going to Bygget…

430
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,680
What do I know?

431
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,560
Okay, Hanna. Tomorrow we'll visit
the pastor that Linus mentioned.

432
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,120
-Raffe, have you confirmed Linus' alibi?
-No.

433
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,440
Jens Wernolf isn't returning my calls.

434
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,640
I'll go to his place tomorrow.

435
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,560
Good.

436
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,320
There, there. Okay, let's…

437
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,440
I have to change her.

438
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,800
I also have to go.
The slope is closing soon.

439
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,520
-Hi.
-Hey.

440
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,120
We're from the police.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.

441
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,400
Hanna. Daniel.

442
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,880
May we come in?

443
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
Yeah, sure.

444
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,960
I'm cooking for my wife.

445
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
She's bedridden.

446
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,960
No, wait a minute.

447
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,680
Can you eat fish while pregnant?

448
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,680
As long as it's farmed.

449
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,920
This is perch that I caught in Åresjön.

450
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,600
Then I wouldn't advise it.

451
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,960
Yeah.

452
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,400
We're having a baby. Our first.

453
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,960
Congratulations.

454
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,680
Thanks.

455
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,600
I thought you might get in touch.

456
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,120
What with Johan's murder and…

457
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,080
Tell me about your relationship
with Johan.

458
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,440
Well, his company was leasing land
from the church for a high ropes course.

459
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,680
There were discussions
on whether to renew the contract or not.

460
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,800
Was Johan upset about it?

461
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,680
Well, it's possible.

462
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,360
But while he was alive,

463
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,120
a majority of the board members
wanted to renew the lease.

464
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
Johan was reliable.

465
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,720
Pilgrimsfjäll?

466
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,760
Yeah.

467
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,640
What's that?

468
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,360
It's a folk high school for Bible studies.

469
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,120
But it's just
at the planning stage for now.

470
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,120
Was Johan involved?

471
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,480
No.

472
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,960
Hi.

473
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,840
Hi, honey.

474
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,240
What are you doing up?

475
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,960
I was just going to the bathroom.

476
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,480
-The doctor said it was okay.
-Yes, of course.

477
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,240
They're from the police.

478
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,920
They're wondering about the congregation's
dealings with J&L Event.

479
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,080
-Hanna.
-Rebecka.

480
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,280
Yes.

481
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,920
Right. This is my colleague, Daniel.

482
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,200
Yeah.

483
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,920
Remember what the doctor said.

484
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
-Not too long.
-No.

485
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,160
I'll be up with some food.

486
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,720
Thank you.

487
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,920
So, any more questions,
or would you like some fish?

488
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,080
No, thank you.

489
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,480
I think we're…

490
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,040
We're done. We'll be in touch
if we have more questions.

491
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:20,960
Okay.

492
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,880
He's lying.

493
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,560
"Pilgrimsfjäll" was written
all over Johan's calendar.

494
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,360
It doesn't mean he's lying.
He might not know about it.

495
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,880
It was weird.

496
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,480
-When she came down?
-Yeah.

497
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,320
Raffe says that Linus' alibi checks out.

498
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,880
What are you looking at?

499
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,360
Östersund has mapped out

500
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,000
where Johan's car was
the weeks prior to his death.

501
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,720
Okay?

502
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,280
What's between Tjärntorpet
and the Fröå mine?

503
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,000
It's a large area of woodland,
close to where we were just now.

504
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,240
Why?

505
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,480
Johan was there two or three times a week.

506
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,840
And time and date correlate
with "Pilgrimsfjäll" in his calendar.

507
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,920
I think his dealings with Ole
went beyond just the land lease.

508
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,440
Okay, I have to take over from Ida's mom.

509
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,960
Shouldn't you take a break?

510
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,960
No.

511
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,000
No, okay. See you tomorrow.

512
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,840
Sure.

513
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,280
Show me.

514
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,400
I've told you to stay in your room.

515
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,280
Don't ever undermine me again.

516
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,920
You have reached your destination.

517
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,240
What are you doing up?
You should be resting.

518
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,240
Nothing.

519
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Hi.

520
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,280
What's that?

521
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,120
Just some clothes I'm giving away.

522
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,280
I mean, soon they won't fit me.

523
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,120
Right.

524
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,400
Why are you lying to me?

525
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,040
I'm not.

526
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,760
Hi.

527
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,760
Hi.

528
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,640
Now's actually not a great time.

529
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,920
Whose skis are those?

530
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,120
They're my wife's.

531
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,440
-I don't ski. I just fall down.
-Right.

532
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,000
-I'd like to talk to her.
-Well…

533
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,240
My wife's going through
a high-risk pregnancy.

534
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,040
She really needs her rest.

535
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,440
Doctor's orders.

536
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,640
Yeah…

537
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,560
Or…

538
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,160
What did you want?

539
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,400
To check if you're okay.

540
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,560
Why wouldn't we be?

541
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,880
Either I call for backup or you let me in.

542
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,360
The police want to talk to you.

543
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,360
-Hi, Rebecka.
-Hi.

544
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,280
I'd like to talk to you. Is it okay?

545
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,960
You can wait outside.

546
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,720
Go ahead.

547
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,800
Did I interrupt anything?

548
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,200
No.

549
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,000
Pretty.

550
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:32,920
Thank you.

551
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,480
It's… kind of like a rosary.

552
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,520
To remind me of God in everyday life.

553
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Like a lifeline.

554
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,160
How are you?

555
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,600
If you want to,
you and I will leave here now.

556
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,320
Do you want that?

557
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,240
-Yes.
-Okay.

558
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
Then let's do that.

559
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,240
It'll be okay.

560
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,400
My colleague will come
to get your version of it.

561
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
-Hi.
-Hi. Welcome.

562
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,360
Thank you.

563
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,240
I called you, or someone here,
maybe two hours ago.

564
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,960
-Yeah, right.
-Yes, exactly.

565
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,800
Hi, Anna. Sorry I haven't called.

566
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,200
-Hi.
-I was…

567
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,680
It's me.

568
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,800
Come home.

569
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,360
I love you.

570
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,000
Hey, don't talk to the police.

571
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,280
I've explained
it was all a misunderstanding.

572
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,000
I promise,
everything's going to be different now.

573
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,120
Where are you?

574
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,400
Granen Hotel, what can I do for you?

575
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,680
Don't call me again.

576
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,080
Thank you.

577
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,360
You knew Johan Andersson, right?

578
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,160
Yes.

579
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,640
May I sit down?

580
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,880
You were a couple, right?

581
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,520
How did you meet?

582
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,920
We met while I was working
on the development of

583
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,440
Pilgrimsfjäll, which is

584
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,680
a folk high school for Bible studies.

585
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,240
And I thought that J&L Events…

586
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,640
Maybe they could help us
with our nature experiences.

587
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,760
And then one thing

588
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,120
led to another.

589
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,960
I loved him…

590
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:13,960
very much.

591
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:21,640
I skied to our meeting place
so that Ole wouldn't suspect anything.

592
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,600
But did… Johan know

593
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,120
how Ole treated you?

594
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,240
What he had done?

595
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,960
Were you and Johan going on a trip?
Or you were going…

596
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,120
Yes, that evening.

597
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:42,160
When Johan found out I was pregnant,
he wanted to get me away from Ole.

598
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,080
But…

599
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,160
But he didn't come to the meeting place,
and he didn't answer his phone.

600
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,480
And then I found out…

601
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,760
Where was Ole
the night Johan was murdered?

602
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,600
I don't know.

603
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,000
I'll let you rest. Take it easy.

604
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,520
We'll bring you in the station tomorrow
and talk there.

605
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,880
Try to stay here in the room.

606
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,040
-Okay?
-Okay.

607
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,400
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

608
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,240
Hi. We have to bring in Ole.

609
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,760
Hold on, we just talked to him.

610
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,280
Yes, I know.
But he could be the one who killed Johan.

611
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:34,880
I'll pick you up.

612
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,080
It looks pretty dark.

613
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,280
Police! Open up!

614
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,000
Hey, Rebecka Nordhammar.
What's her room number?

615
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,120
We can't share any information
about our guests.

616
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,840
She's my wife.

617
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,200
Sorry, it's not possible.

618
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,760
No one's home.

619
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,800
Alain!

620
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,960
Check the back.

621
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,360
-No one's home.
-Okay.

622
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,720
-You stay here.
-Yeah.

623
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,400
She's not picking up.

624
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,120
Call the hotel.

625
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,080
Please. Open the door.

626
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,480
Hey.

627
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:49,880
I just want to talk.

628
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,280
I love you.

629
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
Can you just leave?

630
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,160
If you open the door,
we can talk, and I will explain--

631
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,240
I won't open.

632
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:02,920
I understand.

633
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,200
What I've done is unforgivable.

634
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,720
I want you to know that I'm sorry.

635
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,160
I'm so terribly sorry.

636
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,240
Hey.

637
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,320
I'll get help.
I'll call tomorrow, and I'll…

638
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,680
This is not the kind of father
I want to be.

639
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,680
I love you.

640
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,480
And I want us to be a family.

641
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,720
It's not your child.

642
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,280
Leave.

643
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,840
