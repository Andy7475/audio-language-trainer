I listen to music
Did you listen carefully?
We will listen together
Listen to that noise
I care about you
She didn't care much
Will they care tomorrow?
Who cares for him?
He catches the ball
Did you catch it?
Catch the frisbee!
We will catch fish
Don't catch a cold
She caught the train
They remain at home.
She remained very calm.
Will you remain here?
The problem remains unsolved.
I hope you're right
We hoped for rain
Does it bother you?
The noise bothered me.
I won't bother him.
Don't bother calling her.
I stay at home
We stayed in Paris
Will you stay here?
Stay calm and breathe
She raises her hand
They raised the flag
Will you raise your offer?
We raise chickens here
He raised an issue
I watch television
Watch out!
Did you watch the game?
We'll watch a movie tonight
Watch the baby carefully
I help my mother
She helped me yesterday
Can you help us?
One hour ago
It's a daily test for yourself
The young manager
The best student today
A card for each person
The market on the corner
Everything is all right
It's expensive
A social programme
A day in May is available.
It's not yet possible
A local production centre
This summer in the south
The plan is in the file
A Law degree is hard
Who would know?
Seven is a lucky number
Somebody will know
This type of bread is hard
What an awful smell
The right size
It's moving quickly
Unfortunately it's too late
An honest person
A better option
She is a funny kid
On the front section
The best outcome
A bright colour
