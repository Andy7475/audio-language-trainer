You seem tired today
It seemed like rain
That will seem strange
Plants die without water
My grandfather died yesterday
Everyone will die eventually
My phone battery died
What does this mean?
I didn't mean that.
It will mean trouble.
I mean to help.
You mean everything to me.
I charge my phone daily
They charged too much
Will you charge the battery?
The police charged him
The bull charged forward
Mosquitoes kill many people
The frost killed the plants
This will kill the bacteria
Let me help you
She let the balloon go
Will you let us in?
I let the apartment
I work at home
She worked yesterday
Will you work tomorrow?
Does this phone work?
I'm pulling the lever
I pulled the rope
Will you pull it?
Pull out the tooth
I spend time reading
She spent all her money
Will you spend Christmas here?
They spend summers in France
Don't spend it all today
I think you're right
What did you think?
She'll think about it
I think it's cold
Think before you speak
A light lunch
His stupid suggestion
the heavy movement along the way
A private firm
An expensive holiday
A red light at night
the charge ahead
the sheet instead
till the land
An easy song
his might and weight
anywhere along the way
the police figure
yeah but either way
the likely sound
ready for the act
really interested though
the private court
further along the way
the argument with doubt
the heat from hell
the big if
an ancient Egyptian mummy
his left arm
a big sale on furniture
her long brown hair
the application form
the new housing development
rather cold outside
