I know the answer
Did you know her?
They will know tomorrow
Do you know Paris?
The blanket covers the bed
Snow covered the ground
I will cover the table
Cover yourself in feathers
Does our insurance cover this?
She covered the topic well
He hits the ball
She hit her head
Will it hit the windscreen?
Hit the target!
She manages the team.
I managed the project.
Can you manage it?
He managed to finish.
Can we manage financially?
I always forget names
She forgot her keys
Don't forget to call
Accidents occur every day
The meeting occurred yesterday
When will it occur?
It occurred to me in the bath
I live in America
She lived in Japan
Will you live here?
They live on vegetables
I suggest we leave now
She suggested meeting early
Will you suggest something?
The data suggests an increase
Suggest something different
I carry my bag
She carried the cutlery
Will you carry this?
I'm waiting for you
She waited two hours
Will we wait outside?
Wait here.
A small space within the kitchen
A quiet moment
That's an important health concern
The best position on the stage
A small child with a lady
A free copy of the film
The future of modern art
Another useful product
The main project
Odd and even pages
A list of choices
Two free eggs
Completely through the heart
A high quality service
We are certain
What's the cost in dollars?
A change in the West
Surely the best option
Everyone agrees
Some change in my pocket
I am used to the cold
A kind gesture
A deep hole in the ground
Far from the city
On the wooden table
It requires time and effort
