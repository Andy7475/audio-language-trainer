We will survive this
She survived the accident
They survive on little
The plant survived winter
Did the tradition survive?
I avoid spicy food
She avoided the question
Will you avoid him?
Let's avoid the traffic
I'm expressing my feelings
She expressed her opinion
Will you express yourself?
Book the tickets
She booked a hotel
Will you book the flights?
Police booked the suspect
I visit my grandmother
She visited Paris yesterday
Will you visit us?
Please visit our website
Grab my keys
She grabbed the bag
Let's grab a taxi
Please sign here
She signed the contract
Will you sign it?
They signed the player
I print documents too much
She printed the photo
Will you print this?
The newspaper prints stories
Please print clearly here
I hide my money
She hid the gift
Will you hide it?
They hide behind trees
Don't hide your feelings
I admit my mistake
She admitted the truth
Will you admit it?
They admit all students now
The hospital admitted him
his bright red blood
a professional sport on television
the correct spelling in dictionaries
my friendly uncle from the east
A tremendous amount of attention
some sweet juice in the fridge
a generous allowance from her parents
two perfect circles
that model airplane
the baby asleep in the crib
many fun activities at the park
the eastern part of the country
some soft butter on bread
our comfortable sofa
his calm voice on the phone
her shock after the news
this direct route to the base
an average wage for professionals
active military near the border
these strict regulations
within that category
in close proximity
a busy motorway
much worse than before
that famous quote
an outstanding performance
nothing but the truth
several smooth rocks
my favorite cousin
an inch from disaster
its long tail
several plastic bags
their brave attempt
the group leader
this unique feature
