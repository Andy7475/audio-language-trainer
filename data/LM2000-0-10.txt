I switch channels often
She switched teams yesterday
Will you switch seats?
Switch on the light
Let's switch roles today
They switched to Spanish
I am copying the text
She copied my answer
Will you copy this?
Copy the document
Students often copy homework
She's marking the test
I marked your homework
Will you mark this?
Please mark the spot
They marked the occasion
I rush to work
She rushed home quickly
Don't rush me
Students will rush into class
Does this exist?
Dinosaurs existed long ago
Problems still exist
I propose a solution
Will you propose soon?
They are proposing new legislation
He proposed to her
I owe you money
She owed me ten
Will they owe interest?
You owe an explanation
I'm completing my homework
She completed the task
Will you complete it?
Please complete this form
That completes our meeting
I fail at nothing
She failed her exam
Will they fail again?
The business failed
Don't fail me now
The crops failed completely
She laughs loudly
They laughed yesterday
We will laugh about it tomorrow
Don't laugh at me
We laughed it off
The prestigious university hall
A thorough review of the writing
The creaky wooden stair
Partly above the clouds
A complicated homework assignment
The local town council
A complete description
A research grant for the university
An impressive presentation in the hall
A long way from here
An unusual metal sculpture
A tiny gray mouse
The fish tank on the table
The main theme of the session
A shiny metal pot
The united team members
Easily the best score
The perfect room temperature
A perfect score on the test
It's the rainy season
In a forward position
A shiny disc on the floor
I have mixed feelings about this
My loose tooth
A deeper meaning behind it
My dear friend
A minor detail in the report
So glad about the news
My former self
Whose beautiful painting is this?
An intensive training program
That friendly chap with glasses
It was terribly organised
The automotive industry in this country
The final stop on our journey
The wrong direction at the intersection
A mountain pass in winter
A deep cut on his finger
Some fresh spring flowers
It's not your fault
