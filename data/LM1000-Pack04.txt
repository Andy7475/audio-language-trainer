Babies are born every day
She was born in France
The baby will be born
I guess you're right
She guessed the answer
Can you guess my age?
I guess so
I enjoy reading books
Did you enjoy dinner?
They will enjoy it
I save money monthly
She saved my life
Will it save me water?
Save the document now
He saves every penalty
I remember his name
Do you remember me?
She will remember this
Remember to call her
I'm joining the gym
She joined our team
Will you join us?
Join the two pieces
This job requires experience
The task required patience
Will it require approval?
They build houses here
We built a bridge
Will you build it?
Build something better
They are building a new theatre
Refer to the manual
She referred me to a specialist
Will you refer to your notes?
I'm referring it to management
I hear the music
Did you hear that?
We'll hear it soon
I heard the news
Various tickets in the box
Hopefully very little traffic
I'm against that idea
A letter from the school
A horse on top of the well
A penny for everybody
Something in my eye
The process is quick
Both teams are aware
The letter begins 'Dear Sir'
My son and daughter
We control the bank account
They believe in God
An especially fine silk scarf
Also an interesting place
Play the video again
Two tickets for the concert
It was a suspicous death
We need more support
It's a common feeling
A difference on this side
