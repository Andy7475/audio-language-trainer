I interview candidates tomorrow
She interviewed the witness
Will you interview me?
The interview went well
They conduct job interviews
I fancy chocolate cake
Did you fancy her?
Will they fancy it?
I fancy myself clever
Do you fancy dinner?
I promise to help
She promised yesterday
Will you promise me?
This promises good results
They made a promise
I doubt that
She doubted him
Will you doubt me?
I doubt your story
Do you doubt yourself?
I blame you
She blamed herself
Will they blame us?
Don't blame the weather
He blames his tools
Are you kidding me?
He kidded about it
I will kid around
Don't kid yourself
They kid with friends
Where did it disappear?
My keys disappeared yesterday
It will disappear soon
The sun disappears slowly
Species are disappearing rapidly
I text my friends
She texted me yesterday
Will you text her?
Text the address please
The text is small
Please remove your shoes
She removed the stain
I will remove it
Remove this app
They removed him immediately
She treats patients daily
They treated me well
Will you treat everyone?
Let's treat ourselves
I treated the wood
He treats this seriously
generally in most situations
the true value of friendship
an important notice on the board
our beloved queen with her crown
some chocolate biscuits with ice cream
the emotional appeal of that gift
her perfect score in the competition
a loaded gun in the cabinet
bound by the same principles
the physical strength of an athlete
these exciting moments during the campaign
my injured knee from the competition
a small plane over the southern region
that rusty gate beside their garden
beyond all reasonable expectations
hardly any time for advice
the inner strength of her character
their beautiful wedding in the garden
a powerful drug for joint pain
those silly jokes between neighbors
the busy secretary with a notepad
a blue bucket under the sink
my main purpose in life
that bright spot on the ceiling
social media without privacy
directly across from the store
first aid for minor injuries
some mashed potato with butter
these wooden blind slats
a spider web in the corner
the total amount due
his strong will against obstacles
our friendly neighbour next door
many benefits from regular exercise
an electric car with solar panels
their married life together
a basic principle of economics
her unique style in fashion
that wooden chest under the bed
a scientific theory about gravity
my excellent credit score
their strategic move
